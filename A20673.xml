            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IIII. That Faith, or beleefe in God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, is neceſſarie to Mans Content and Happineſſe: but not onely Faith, without the coniunction and connextion to other vertues.</head>
               <p>THat Faith, and beleefe in <hi>God,</hi> is neceſſarie to Mans Content &amp; Happineſſe, is firſt manifeſt by reaſon: for that the firſt thing which is to be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6338:34"/> ſought for, in any Queſtion, is, <hi>Whether the thing be, or no;</hi> and <note place="margin">Ariſt. poſt. li. 2. c. 1.</note> vntill we beleeue it to be, it is in vaine to ſeeke how, or after what manner it is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the Scriptures, which ſay, that <hi>without faith, it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>is vnpoſſible to pleaſe God: for he that commeth to God, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he is, and is a rewarder of them that ſeeke him.</hi> Againe, <hi>He that beleeueth not, ſhall be</hi>

                  <hi>condemned.</hi> Again, <hi>He that doth not beleeue, is alreadie iudged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet that Faith only, without the connexion to other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, is not of it ſelfe ſufficient to Happineſſe, is manifeſt by the light of Grace &amp; Nature.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For that wee beleeue many things to be, which we would not haue, nor enioy; as Hell, and eternall paines.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:6338:35"/>
               <p> Secondly, To beleeue that there is Happineſſe, is not to be happie; otherwiſe, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, and damned ſoules in Hell, ſhould be happie, ſince they beleeue, that there is Happineſſe, and lament for the loſſe of it, ſaying, <hi>Wee</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Faith endeth with <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 12. 1. Io. 3. 2.</note> this life: ſo, if Happineſſe conſiſted in onely Faith, there were no Happineſſe after death.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Faith may ſtand with ſinne, and malice: ſinne, and malice, is wittingly to doe againſt that we beleeue
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6338:35"/> in conſcience; and ſo one might be both happie and wretched together; which is contrarie to experience.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, If onely Faith were ſufficient to Happineſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the connexion or coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to other vertues, there could be no impietie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; nor no man ſhould be wicked, vniuſt, or vnhappie, for any fact, how horrible ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, vnleſſe hee denied Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith: and all Lawes, and execution of Iuſtice vpon any one whoſoeuer, but vpon ſuch as denyed Articles of Faith, ſhould be Tyrannie and Crueltie; as made, to put to death a happie and iuſt man, who had committed no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe, or impietie.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, It is contrarie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6338:36"/> that a man ſhould be happie by Faith onely: For though the whole Engliſh Clergie of Proteſtants, in the eleuenth Article of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Creed, affirme in theſe words, <hi>That we are iuſtified by Faith onely, is a moſt wholeſome Doctrine, and very full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;</hi> yet we ſhall neuer heare, or find, that any of their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie hath left the comfort of a Benefice, good Fare, fine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, worldly Riches and Commodities, to practiſe and enioy <hi>this moſt wholeſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and very full of comfort, Happineſſe by faith onely.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to be put to the practice of their Doctrine, and liue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, to enioy no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6338:78"/> Citie of <hi>Venice</hi> vpon the fiue and twentieth day of March, in the yeare of our Lord foure hundred twentie and one, which hath continued euer ſince in the Catholike Faith, &amp; vnion of the Church of GOD, dilated ouer the World, without alteration or change in Religion or State; or hauing beene ſacked or ſpoiled, as their Hiſtories and ſucceſſion of Men, from age to age, doe abundantly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</p>
               <p>Whereby thou ſeeſt, that our Catholike Church is ſo manifeſtly the true Church, that vnleſſe thou wilt firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in effect and deed, that <hi>God</hi> Almightie is periured and forſworne, thou canſt not denie it; &amp; that the Church of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6338:78"/> the Proteſtants is ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the falſe Church, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affirming in effect and deeds, that <hi>God</hi> Almightie may be forſworne, it cannot in any one Article bee defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>And the ſame thou ſhalt finde in any other queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as for example; thou wouldeſt examine whether Catholike Prieſts, that offer to <hi>God</hi> the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, or Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who haue no exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sacrifice, be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prieſts: admit but of the Oathes of <hi>God</hi> for true, without malice and paſſion, and the Controuerſie is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and it is as manifeſt vnto thee, by both the Oathes of <hi>God,</hi> that Maſſing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6338:79"/> Prieſts are true Chriſtian Prieſts, as it is manifeſt, that <hi>God</hi> Almightie cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne. Of the firſt Oath we haue ſpoken before. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Oath is; <note place="margin">Pſ. 109. Heb. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Our Lord hath ſworne, and it ſhall not repent him, thou art a Prieſt for euer, according to the Order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck.</hi> Firſt, of Proteſtant Miniſters, there were none for many hundreth yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, viſibly knowne in the World, as they confeſſe: ſo this eternall Prieſthood of Chriſt could not be verified in them, as in his Prieſts or Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they haue no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>That Catholike Prieſts haue beene theſe many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares offering to <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:6338:79"/> (as Miniſters of his Sonne) his Bodie and Bloud, vnder the formes of Bread &amp; Wine, according to the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> as they doe now; that, Proteſtants confeſſe; as wee haue immediatly before ſet downe.</p>
               <p>So do but admit, that <hi>God</hi> Almightie is not forſworne in both theſe Oathes; and of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie thou muſt defend, that Maſſing Prieſts are true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prieſts, and Proteſtant Miniſters falſe. And in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtions &amp; Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies firmely beleeue the Oaths of <hi>God,</hi> which are the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and infallible truths that may be; and ſuch, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon all the reſt of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures depend; and honour <hi>God</hi> Almightie, by maintaining
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6338:80"/> them in words and deeds, and thinke, that thy Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Wit, and Iudgement, may deceiue thee, as they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times doe; but the Oathes of <hi>God</hi> cannot, and thou canſt not but be a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or Papiſt. So manifeſt it is, that our Catholike Faith is founded vpon the Oathes of <hi>God,</hi> and Proteſtantiſme of all Sects and ſorts, is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon Publike profeſſion in acts and deeds, that <hi>God</hi> Almightie is periured and forſworne; that if paſſion and malice doe not blinde the light of reaſon in thee, thou canſt not but ſee it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Eaſe, Content, and Reſt, vpon the ſureſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations

               <head>CHAP. IX. That hope in God is alſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Content, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of Man, but not only Hope, without other vertues. And how acts of Hope made by Catholikes, include Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other Vertues, and not exclude them.</head>
               <p>THat it is impoſſible to be ſaued, or finde Content without hope in <hi>God,</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by reaſon.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:6338:81"/>
               <p> Firſt, for that no man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth for that which he no waies hopeth to obtaine, nor yet is carefull to keepe that which he eſteemeth impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inioy.</p>
               <p>Againe, vpon want of hope ariſeth deſpaire and puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of mind; both which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſions of ſadneſſe and diſcontent, depriue vs of the Ioy and Content we ſeeke after.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is manifeſt by the Scriptures, which in plain tearms affirme, <hi>That by Hope we</hi>

                  <hi>away from Sinners, and ſaue them, becauſe they haue hoped in him.</hi> Whereby is manifeſt, that without the vertue of Hope, no man can be happy, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>But as wee ſaid before, of onely Faith; that Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other vertues, is dead to Grace in this life, and Glorie in the other, and ſerueth ſuch as haue it, for nothing but for the increaſe of eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſo alſo it is manifeſt,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6338:82"/> that onely Hope, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues, is a vaine and dead Hope; without any true Content in this life, or in all eternitie; as is manifeſt firſt by reaſon.</p>
               <p>Becauſe Hope endeth with Death: ſo if the Content and Happineſſe of Man ſhould conſiſt in onely Hope, there ſhould be no Content in the other life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſee (ſome few excepted, who fall into vtter deſpaire) that all men, of all Sects and ſorts, and how wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſoeuer, hope for Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Content: So, if Hope, without the aſſiſtance of other vertues, were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Happineſſe, men might be happie and wretched both together; which is contrarie to experience.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:6338:82"/>
               <p> Thirdly, to hope for Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, is not to be happie; ſince none hopeth for that he hath, but enioyeth. Whereby is manifeſt, that onely Hope is not ſufficient to be happie.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Scriptures ſay, <hi>Not euerie one that ſaith, Lord,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heauen.</hi> Againe, <hi>Many ſhall ſay to me in that Day,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, Lord, haue not wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied in thy Name, and in thy Name caſt out Deuils, and in thy Name wrought many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? And then I will confeſſe vnto them, that I neuer knew you depart from me you that worke iniquitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And our <hi>Sauiour</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thoſe who hope to be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6338:83"/> ſaued, and are negligent in gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning other vertues, and vſing the meanes he hath ordained for the ſaluation of mankind, vnto fooliſh Virgins; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited to a Mariage, neglected to prepare themſelues for the Mariage vntil it was too late, and ſo were ſhut out with this anſwer, <hi>Amen I ſay to you, I know you not.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whereby is manifeſt, that the Promiſes are not made to a dead Hope, which is void of other vertues, but to ſuch a Hope, as is conioint to all other vertues, and is void of all iniquitie.</p>
               <p>Heere thou mayeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, deere Reader, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of many Proteſtants; who being driuen from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Doctrine of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:6338:83"/> by Faith only, fall vpon Iuſtification by Hope onely, without Faith, Charitie, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or other vertues: and not knowing nor regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what Faith they ought to profeſſe, nor what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements they haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; preſume to be ſaued by a vaine Hope, in the Paſſion of our Lord, and ſo periſh in their preſumption; thinking, that to ſay onely, <hi>I hope to be ſaued by the Paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> without Faith, Charitie, Sacraments, &amp;c. is ſufficient to remit their ſinnes, and ſaue their ſoules, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and wicked ſoeuer they haue liued; and ſo die Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes and Infidels; of no Faith nor Religion, for all their hope.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:6338:84"/>
               <p> When Catholikes ſay, <hi>they hope to be ſaued by the merits of the Paſſion of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour;</hi> they doe not exclude the Sacraments, Faith and other vertues, but ſuppoſe them, and include them &amp; all other meanes whatſoeuer <hi>God</hi> Almightie hath giuen or left vs for our Saluation: yea, the whole merit or benefit of his Paſſion, and things gained for vs; as Faith, Hope, Charitie, Sacraments, aſſiſtance of the holie <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. And the ſenſe of the words are; <hi>I hope to be ſaued by no other meanes, then thoſe which thou haſt gained for me by thy Paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe in all other acts of vertues, or Sacraments, Catholikes doe include the whole merit of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6338:84"/> the Paſſion of our Sauiour: as whether they make acts of Contrition; as, <hi>Lord bee mercifull to mee a poore ſinner:</hi> or of Loue; as, <hi>I deſire to loue thee, deare Lord, with all my heart:</hi> or of Hope; as, <hi>I hope by the helpe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to be ſaued:</hi> they doe not exclude any other vertue, or meanes, but in all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of theſe Actes doe include all the meanes and benefits of our <hi>Lords</hi> whole Paſſion; offering vp theſe Actes, and whatſoeuer Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian worke they doe, to <hi>God</hi> the Father, in vnion with the Paſſion of our <hi>Lord,</hi> vpon the Croſſe, for the remiſſion of their ſinnes; and vſe theſe Acts, Sacraments, and good Deedes, done in Grace, as a

               <p>For though our <hi>Lord</hi> died fo all the World; yet none receiue the benefit of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but thoſe who diligently and carefully vſe the meanes he hath ordained ſhould be vſed, for the receiuing of the benefit thereof; which are, Faith, Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, good Deeds, and acts of vertue: by theſe, as by inſtruments, receiuing the merit and benefit of our <hi>Lords</hi> Paſſion, his graces and fauours purchaſed for vs. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting vs, ſaith; <hi>Our deſire is, that euery one of</hi>

               <p>THat it is not poſſible for Man to be content, and happie, without the loue of <hi>God,</hi> is manifeſt by the light of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>For if I had what things ſoeuer can be giuen me, and yet did not loue them, I ſhould not find; or receiue, any true content, or ioyes, from them: and yet thoſe who loue things that are not good, are deceiued; and Time diſcouering Deceits, they will remaine afflicted.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6338:90"/> Againe, thoſe who loue ſuch things as haue an end; at their end, or parting, they will reſt comfortleſſe: whereby is manifeſt by the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that true Content, and Ioyes, cannot be without true Loue; nor true Loue, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be placed in louing a perpetuall Good.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6338:97"/> all true Content and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. If thou wilt beleeue the Scriptures, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Contrition, or ſorrow for ſinne, doth much differ from the ſorrow, or lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of worldly men; when out of ſelfe-loue, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the loſſe of their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commodities, or Pleaſures. The fruites of this Sorrow, are Sadneſſe, Oppreſſion of Minde, and Diſcontent, as being inordinate, and not ordained by <hi>God</hi> to be vſed as a meanes of finding Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe: vvhereas Penance, Contrition, and Sorrow for Sinnes, beeing meanes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by <hi>God,</hi> to Content and Happineſſe; the more thou vſeſt them, the more reſt, and content of heart,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:6338:97"/> thou ſhalt finde; becauſe <hi>God</hi> Almightie doth <hi>reuiue the</hi>

                  <hi>heart of the Contrite,</hi> by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi>

               <p>A ſecond meanes of attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the <hi>loue</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is often to Communicate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the words of our Lord, ſaying; <hi>He that eateth</hi>

                  <hi>my Fleſh, and drinketh my Bloud, abideth in me, and I in him:</hi> which is the Charitie wee ſeeke for.</p>
               <p>A third meanes, is Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſeriouſly to conſider all the benefits thou haſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from his diuine Maieſtie; as, Creation, Redemption, Conſeruation, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6338:98"/> graces thou haſt, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteſt; and likewiſe, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate often vpon his diuine Attributes, as his infinite Goodneſſe, Beautie, Maieſtie, and Power, &amp;c. for the onely meanes to loue any thing that is very good, faire, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and beautifull; is but to looke ſeriouſly vpon it, and conſider it well, and the loue or liking of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently is begotten in thy heart. And it being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently good, the more thou thinkeſt, or medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt vpon it, the more the loue of it increaſeth in thee. So if thou wilt loue much GOD Almightie, doe not omit thy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>A fourth meanes is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:6338:98"/> to keepe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>God;</hi> that hauing alwayes before thine eyes an infinite Good, from whom all things elſe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row whatſoeuer good they haue; thou canſt not but little eſteeme of all other goods, in compariſon of it, and loue it with thy whole heart, and all things elſe, as they may conduct thee vnto it: of which Preſence wee are to ſpeake in our third Booke.</p>
               <p>A fifth meanes is, to make many Acts of the loue of <hi>God:</hi> As in Arts and Sciences, thy continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all practiſe increaſeth thy knowledge and skill; ſo the making of many Acts of the loue of <hi>God,</hi> increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

               <p>SO great is the Obligation and bond of Societie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed betweene all things created; that the good of one, in ſome ſort, dependeth vpon the loue and ſocietie with the other: The <hi>Angels</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen reioice one at anothers good and Happineſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue increaſe of Content, by the increaſe of Glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon any one: The <hi>Heauens</hi> ſend downe ſhowers and dew, to water and make

The <hi>Elements</hi> liue in a perpetuall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of amitie; the Fire tranſporting it ſelfe into Ayre, the Ayre into Water, and the Water into Earth; and the Earth condenſing and becomming hard, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againe to yeeld Fire; and their intercourſe of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is confirmed in ſo firme a league, that rather then the Earth ſhould in any thing periſh by ſuffering <hi>vacuum;</hi> the Ayre, or Fire, forgetfull of his owne well, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; of his owne will and

               <p>Thou muſt not imagine, that all thoſe who haue the

               <p>Fourthly, the Diuell is their Maſter in ſpirituall things; inſomuch, as they muſt doe, for the moſt part, what he will: for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void of inherent grace, and of the aſſiſtance of the holy <hi>Ghoſt, Which will</hi>

               <p>FIrſt, it is an horror to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that any man ſhould be truely Happy, or Content, who keepeth not the whole Law, or Commandements of <hi>God:</hi> as, that a Fornicator, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer, Drunkard, Man-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Vſurer, Extortioner, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured perſon, or Hater of <hi>God,</hi> ſhould be receiued into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or liue with any Content vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth: for, becauſe we ſee, that ſuch as are guiltie of theſe

               <head>CHAP. XVI. What it is to be content and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and how Content, and Happineſſe, conſiſteth in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God Almightie with all our hearts, and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for Gods ſake, as our ſelues.</head>
               <p>WE ſee by experience, that then euery one is well pleaſed, when he hath that which he loueth, and loueth that which he ought. Of all the affections in the ſoule, Loue is the ſtrongeſt; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as Loue is ſaid to be <note place="margin">Cant. 8.</note> as ſtrong as Death; and Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, or feare, to loſe that which wee loue, is ſaid to be as hard as Hell: euery
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:6338:140"/> one beeing ſo loth to part from that which he loueth, that of all paines it is the greateſt. So that in Loues mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſatisfied and filled all the other affections of our ſoules: for who is delighted, but in that which he loueth? or who hateth, flyeth, or is ſorrowfull, but for ſome euill, which may ſeparate him from the good he loueth? or who hopeth, or deſpaireth, but in the difficultie he findeth in obtaining the good he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth? or who feareth, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, or is angrie, but at the euill which oppoſeth it ſelfe to the good he deſireth? ſo that in Loues motions are complete all our happineſſe, and affections. <hi>If a man ſhall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>giue all the ſubſtance of his houſe</hi>

                  <hi>for loue, as nothing he will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe it.</hi> He is violently carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whom loue driueth; and he was neuer poore, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, that found what he deſired: and all ſo earneſtly deſire that which they loue, as aske of any one whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, what is that which hath greateſt force with him? and he will anſwere, his loue, and pleaſure: Yet all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which a man can take, are in ſome ſpeciall, good, that is, honeſt, profitable, and delightfull; for he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth that which is diſhoneſt, is aſhamed; he that deſireth that which is not profitable, looſeth; and he that deſireth that which proueth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, repenteth; and he that obtaineth that which is
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:6338:141"/> honeſt, and yet hath not in it all honeſtie, is defectiue; and hee that obtaineth that which is profitable, yet hath not all the profit that he is capable of to receiue, is ſtill poore; and hee that hath that which delighteth him, and yet not all delights, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: whereby we gather, that the good which may giue vs complete content, may be of all things honeſt, the moſt honeſt; of all things profitable, the moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and of all things delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the moſt pleaſing: and yet one it muſt needes be; for if in one thing I ſhould loue honeſtie, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, profit, I ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided; and diuiſion weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth loue, breaketh affection,

               <p>Whereupon I anſwere, that according to the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon, Content doth not only conſiſt in Loue, but in louing one thing, which hath in it, all hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, profite, and pleaſure, and all other things for it; and that one thing is to be euery where, and in all places, which is, <hi>God</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, call it what you will, <hi>This is my God, and</hi>
